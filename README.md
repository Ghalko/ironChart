This is an animated Eisenhower chart with an extra area.

|  | Urgent | Timely  | Planning/nice to do |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Important      |  |  |  |
| Not important  |  |  |  |

Timely refers to activities that might have a point in time when it becomes possible to do the activity but it doesn't need to be urgent until the last few days/opportunities. In otherwords, reserving urgent for those truly urgent things that need to be done *now!* Of course this division could help or hinder procrastinators.
